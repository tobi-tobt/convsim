# ConvSim

ConvSim is a fast simulation framework for 3D coded aperture imaging. It computes the detector image from a 3D volume distribution of gamma sources described as a voxel cube.  

Detailed description:
*T. Mei√üner and S. Pietrantonio et al., "Towards a fast and accurate simulation framework for 3D spherical source
localization in the near field of a coded aperture gamma camera," 2023.* 

ConvSim requires the following Python packages:
* numpy 1.19
* tensorflow 2.5.0
* opencv-python 4.6.0.66
* matplotlib 3.5.0

Please note the following:
* We publish the software as it is, do not guarantee proper performance and do not provide support
* Nevertheless, we highly acknowledge feedback. Use the issues functionality in github. If you feel like contributing, just open a pull request.
